### Cloned from original repo found at https://github.com/kitft/funsearch/tree/main 

# Funsearch

A high-performance implementation of program search using LLMs, built for discovering mathematical algorithms and solving optimization problems. We essentially run a genetic programming algorithm with LLMs as the mutation/breeding operator.

This funsearch repo adds parallel processing, updated tooling, and many more features compared to the original *funsearch*. It should be relatively user-friendly.

## Features

### Modified to support non-priority-function program search
- Search for any type signature, not just priority functions. E.g., searching for a bool-valued `is_member` function, or a matrix multiplication algorithm.
- Runs on multiple inputs at once (e.g. n=8,9,10 for cap sets)

### Integration with Weights & Biases
- Real-time monitoring and logging/graphing

### Multi-Model Support
- Use any combination of modern LLMs including Claude/GPT-4o/Gemini/Mistral/Deepseek/etc through direct APIs or OpenRouter
- Use multiple models in the same run:  multiple models with different temperatures, etc
- Adaptive sampling rates based on LLM/CPU/evaluator capacity

### Parallel Processing
- Runs multiple program evaluations simultaneously across CPU cores
- Makes asynchronous API calls to sampler/evaluator/database agents

### Safety Features
- Sandboxed code execution (container or process-based), code checked before runtime for safety. NB - not fully 'safe' when multithreaded.
- Model validation before search starts/graceful handling of API failures

For implementation details and example problems, see the examples directory, particularly the section on *Adding additional programs*. Remember to modify the system prompt and user prompts in the spec file!





## Installation and Setup

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Install Docker and python 3.10+. Make sure the docker service is running.
   
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory

`git clone https://github.com/kitft/funsearch.git`
`cd funsearch`
   
3. Set your API keys by creating a `.env` file in the project root (this file will be automatically gitignored):
   ```
   # Create a .env file in the project root
   touch .env
   
   # Add your API keys to the .env file:
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
   WANDB_API_KEY=<your_wandb_key_here>
   DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=<your_deepinfra_key_here>
   ```
5. If you're using Docker desktop, open the app. Then, build the Docker image with the command below. This may take a while, especially the first time. You will need to re-build if you update the Dockerfile or edit the code. You should not need to re-build if you are only updating the input python file or input data. Create a data folder and run the container

   ```
   mkdir data
   docker build . -t funsearch
   docker run -it -v ./data:/workspace/data -v ./examples:/workspace/examples --env-file .env funsearch
   ```

## Model Selection
- Any model name containing a slash (/) will automatically use the OpenRouter API. For example:
  - 'anthropic/claude-3-opus'
  - 'google/gemini-pro'
  - 'meta-llama/llama-2-70b-chat'
  - 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b'
- You can find the full list of available models at https://openrouter.ai/docs
- Multiple models can be specified using comma separation with optional counts and key numbers:
  - `model1*count1*key1,model2*count2*key2`
  - Example: `codestral-latest*10*0,mistralai/codestral_mamba*5*1` will use 10 codestrals from mistral, and 5 mistral-tinys from openrouter.
- Note the key numbers are used to differentiate between different API keys for the same model. These can be passed as separate environment variables with integers on the end. The separate ones will only be used if the key number is greater than 0.
- You can also specify a model from OpenAI or Anthropic, etc. If this doesn't work, have a look at models.py
- Setting model temperatures: pass a list of temperatures, one for each model. Format: "temperature1,temperature2,..."
- Before starting the search, each model is validated to ensure it's working correctly:

## Advice
- Run the search with the desired model using the '--model' attribute.
- A good one to use for testing, as an extremely cheap model, is 'mistral-tiny-latest'. 
- The best one for our use case is probably 'codestral-latest', which is 4x more expensive per output token.
- Another great one might be deepseek/deepseek-chat, which is competitive with claude-3-5-sonnet and much cheaper.
- Either model is still relatively cheap: with codestral, 1 million output tokens is $0.6.
- You can also pass in a model name from OpenAI or Anthropic, etc. If this doesn't work, have a look at models.py
- One should be careful what functions are imorted at the start of the SPEC file, as this will be available to the evolving function written by the LLM. You can change which functions and packages are allowed/blacklisted by changing evolve.py.
-- By default, the following packages are allowed: 'itertools', 'numpy', 'np', 'math', 'functools', 'collections', 'random'
-- By default the following functions are blacklisted: '\_\_import\_\_', 'breakpoint', 'compile', 'open', 'dir', 'eval', 'exec', 'globals', 'input', 'repr', 'np.savetxt', 'np.loadtxt', 'np.genfromtxt', 'np.fromfile', 'np.tofile', 'np.frombuffer', 'np.save', 'np.savez', 'np.savez_compressed', 'np.load'

## Running the search
`funsearch runasync` takes two arguments and several options:

1. `SPEC_FILE`: A Python module that provides the basis of the LLM prompt as well as the evaluation metric.
   - Example: See `examples/cap_set_spec.py`

2. `INPUTS`: Can be one of the following:
   - A filename ending in .json or .pickle
   - Comma-separated input data
   - The files are expected to contain a list with at least one element
   - Elements will be passed to the `solve()` method one by one
   - Programs will be evaluated based on an aggregated score, which is the sum of the scores for each input. Each individual best score per input will be logged to wandb.

Examples of valid INPUTS:
- 8
- 8,9,10
- ./examples/cap_set_input_data.json

Key options:
- `--model`: The LLM model to use (default: "codestral-latest","mistralai/codestral-mamba")
- `--samplers`: Number of sampler threads (default: 15)
- `--evaluators`: Number of evaluator processes (default: CPU cores - 1)
- `--islands`: Number of islands for genetic algorithm (default: 10)
- `--duration`: Run duration in seconds (default: 3600)
- `--team`: Wandb team/entity for logging (optional)
- `--name`: Wandb ID for run
- `--tag`: Wandb tag for run
- `--token_limit`: Maximum number of output tokens (default: None)# add this if you want to limit by number of tokens used
- `--relative_cost_of_input_tokens`: Cost ratio of input/output tokens (default: 1.0)# add this if you want to limit by number of tokens used. Typically this number will be less than one.

Example command:
```bash
funsearch runasync /workspace/examples/cap_set_spec.py 8 --sandbox ExternalProcessSandbox --model mistralai/codestral-mamba --samplers 20 --islands 10 --duration 3000 --team <team> --tag <tag> --token_limit 1000000 --relative_cost_of_input_tokens 0.5
```

### Weights & Biases Integration

The search progress is automatically logged to Weights & Biases (wandb). You can specify a team/entity for logging in two ways:

1. Using the `--team` option:
   - If provided, will use that team as default with a 10-second countdown
   - During countdown, you can press Enter to enter a different entity
   - After countdown, automatically proceeds with the specified team

2. Without `--team`:
   - Prompts for entity name
   - Press Enter to use wandb default (no entity)

To use wandb:
1. Set your wandb API key:
   ```bash
   export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_wandb_key_here>
   ```
2. Run funsearch with optional team:
   ```bash
   funsearch runasync ... --team myteam
   ```

The following metrics are logged to wandb:
- Best and average scores for each island
- Overall best and average scores
- Queue sizes
- API call counts
- Other relevant metrics

Additionally, scores are logged to CSV files in `./data/scores/`, and graphs are generated in `./data/graphs/` showing the progression of scores over time.

The number of evaluator processes is limited to the number of CPU cores minus 1, or the number specified in --evaluators, whichever is smaller.AsyncAgentsConfig

The number of samplers is controlled via --samplers. You should tune this number to match the capabilities of your API key(s).

The number of islands is controlled via --islands. 10 is typically a good default as it provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.

Any parameters not listed here can be modified in `funsearch/config.py`. Particular parameters of interest are the LLM top_p, temperature (as distinct from the temperature used for sampling from the islands). We set these to the same values as the original funsearch paper: 0.95 and 1.0 respectively. This probably requires some tuning for different problems/LLM models.

You may be interested in modifying the system prompt in the spec file, or the default system prompt in `funsearch/config.py`, which is used if no system prompt is specified in the spec file.

The search will automatically stop if:
- The eval queue size exceeds 500 items
- The result queue size exceeds 50 items 
- The specified duration is reached
- A keyboard interrupt is received

Here are the available run parameters:

- `spec_file`: A file containing the specification for the problem to be solved. This includes the base prompt for the LLM and the evaluation metric.
- `inputs`: The input data for the problem. This can be a filename ending in .json or .pickle, or comma-separated values.
- `--model`: The name of the language model (or models) to use. Default is "codestral-latest", which uses the Mistral api. Format: model1*count1*key1,model2*count2*key2`,...etc
- `--sandbox`: The type of sandbox to use for code execution. Default for multithreaded is "ExternalProcessSandbox".
- `--output_path`: The directory where logs and data will be stored. Default is "./data/".
- `--load_backup`: Path to a backup file of a previous program database to continue from a previous run: e.g. "./data/backups/program_db_priority_identifier_0.pickle"
- `--iterations`: The maximum number of iterations per sampler. Default is -1 (unlimited).
- `--sandbox`: The type of sandbox to use for code execution. Default is "ContainerSandbox".
- `--samplers`: The number of sampler threads to run. Default is 15.
- `--evaluators`: The number of evaluator processes to run. Default is the number of CPU cores minus 1.
- `--islands`: The number of islands for the island model in the genetic algorithm. Default is 10.
- `--reset`: The time between island resets in seconds. Default is 600 (10 minutes).
- `--duration`: The duration in seconds for which the search should run. Default is 3600 (1 hour).
- `--temperature`: LLM temperature. Default is 1.0. Can also give a list of temperatures - one for each entry in --model. Format: "temperature1,temperature2,..."
- `--team`: Wandb team/entity for logging (optional)
- `--envfile`: Path to a .env file to load environment variables from. This is only useful if you are running the search outside of a container.
- `--token_limit`: Maximum number of output tokens (default: None)# add this if you want to limit by number of tokens used
- `--relative_cost_of_input_tokens`: Cost ratio of input/output tokens (default: 1.0)# add this if you want to limit by number of tokens used. Typically this number will be less than one.

## Example
Here, we are searching for the algorithm to find maximum cap sets for dimension 11.
You should see something like:
```
root@11c22cd7aeac:/workspace# funsearch runasync /workspace/examples/cap_set_spec.py 11 --sandbox ExternalProcessSandbox --model codestral-latest
INFO:root:Writing logs to data/1704956206
INFO:absl:Best score of island 0 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 1 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 2 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 3 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 4 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 5 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 6 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 7 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 8 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 9 increased to 2048
INFO:absl:Best score of island 5 increased to 2053
INFO:absl:Best score of island 1 increased to 2049
INFO:absl:Best score of island 8 increased to 2684
^C^CINFO:root:Keyboard interrupt. Stopping.
INFO:absl:Saving backup to data/backups/program_db_priority_1704956206_0.pickle.
```

You may also see `INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` for each successful API call.

Note that in the last command, we use the ExternalProcessSandbox. This is not fully 'safe', but does make it a bit less likely that invalid code from LLM could break things. However, before code is executed, it is checked for safety by ensuring that the code does not contain any forbidden functions, and only imports allowlisted libraries. There are many ways around the security implemented here, but it is judged to be sufficient for our purposes. These can be configured in `funsearch/evaluator.py`. There is also ContainerSandbox, which is more secure but not multithreaded. 

Alternatively, you can run the main Python process on a host computer outside of any container and let
the process build and run separate sandbox containers (still requires Docker(/Podman)).
This variant could be also used, e.g., in Colab relatively safely since the environment is some kind of container itself.

```
mkdir -p data
pip install .
source .env #need to source the .env file to get the API keys
funsearch runasync examples/cap_set_spec.py 11
```

# PROGRAM DATABASE BACKUPS


The program database is automatically backed up every 500 programs, with 5 rotating backups labelled 0-4, where the most recent backup is not necessarily labelled 0. These are stored in the `./data/backups/` directory. You can resume from a backup with the `--load_backup` option. 


To inspect a backup of a program database, you can use the `funsearch ls./data/backups/program_db_priority_<identifier>/program_db_priority_<identifier>_<backup_number>.pickle` command.

# LOGS AND GRAPHS

You can monitor the progress of the search using Weights & Biases (wandb). First, make sure you have set your wandb API key (in the .env file), or otherwise set the WANDB_API_KEY environment variable inside the container.

```
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_wandb_key_here>
```

The search progress will be automatically logged to your wandb project "funsearch". You can view the results in real-time by:
1. Going to https://wandb.ai
2. Logging in with your account
3. Opening the "funsearch" project
4. Selecting your run

Each run will be named with a timestamp (e.g., "run_<model_name>_1704956206") and will track:
- Best and average scores for each island
- Overall best and average scores
- Queue sizes
- API call counts
- Other relevant metrics

Additionally, the scores are logged to a csv file in `./data/scores/`, and at the end of the `runasync` a graph of the best scores per island over time is generated in `./data/graphs/` (at this point, `matplotlib` and `pandas` are installed - this is just to improve docker compilation time). This can be generated by hand using `funsearch makegraphs <timestamp>`.

To remove/delete all data associated with a timestamp(s), use the following command. This is not reversible, so be careful!
```
funsearch removetimestamp <timestamp1> <timestamp2> ...
```



## OEIS Integration

The project includes functionality to fetch and save sequences from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). This is particularly useful when implementing mathematical sequence-based problems.

### Using the OEIS Command

You can fetch and save OEIS sequences using the CLI. This saves a `*.pkl` file and a `*.json` file in the `./examples/oeis_data/` directory.

```bash
# Basic usage - saves to ./examples/oeis_data/A001011.pkl
funsearch oeis A001011

# Save to custom location
funsearch oeis A001011 custom/path/

# Limit number of terms
funsearch oeis A001011 --max-terms 100
```

### Using OEIS Sequences in Your Implementation

1. First, fetch the sequence using the CLI command as shown above
2. Then in your implementation spec file, load it like this:
```python

def solve(n: int):
   import pickle
   """Your solve function"""
   with open('examples/oeis_data/A001011.pkl', 'rb') as f:
       sequence = pickle.load(f)
   # Use sequence as needed

If you want each element of the sequence to have performance logged separately, use the pkl file (or its equivalent json) as your input to the funsearch runasync command.

```

The sequences are saved as Python lists of integers and can be easily integrated into your implementation specs.

# ERRORS

PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE UPDATED TO THE LATEST VERSION OF THIS REPO

If you are getting OPENAI Async doesn't exist errors, run `pip install openai>=1.2` in your Docker environment. This should happen on Dockerfile creation, but could be a problem if you have some legacy docker/pdm files.

Logging and debugging: can be set by running `export LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG` in the terminal before running funsearch.

# Adding additional programs:
To add additional programs, add .py files to the examples/ directory. These should follow the same structure as the other examples - a function with an @funsearch.evolve decorator, and an evaluation function which returns a score decorated with @funsearch.run. See `examples/cap_set_spec.py` for a simple example, and see `examples/Example_Implementation_SPEC.py` for template which you can fill in. I have also been writing playground `*.ipynb` files in the `examples/playgrounds/` directory, where new environments can be developed and tested.
